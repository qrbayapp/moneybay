# Welcome to Jekyll!

This is your first blog post. You can edit it by modifying the file `_posts/2024-03-21-welcome-to-jekyll.md`.

## Adding New Posts

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter.

## Basic Markdown Formatting

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```
